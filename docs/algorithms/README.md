# Algorithms

Algorithms are a fascinating topic, the heart of computer science. To perform any action, a computer must be given all instructions to execute step by step. Algorithms are unambiguous specification that drives problem solving. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing, sorting, formating, etc. Algorithms are meant to automate processes.

I'm in love with some of them because they are beautifully simple or incredibly elegant. This section will handle my favorites.

* [Fountain Codes](https://divan.github.io/posts/fountaincodes/) - Transfer information over noisy channels. Example given with [txqr](https://github.com/divan/txqr) a project that uses Animated QR codes to transfer data over mobiles.
* Any [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/) essays, demo, experiments. This inspired me so much and make myself questioning my day to day life as an engineer. He made me rethink the way we explain and learn things and share them with peers. I'm so frustrated not seeing his demos becoming real life products.
  * [Algojammer](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Algojammer) - A project that stole the idea of "Learning programming" is an attempt to turn Bret's work into reality.
