# Algorithm

* [Fountain Codes](https://divan.github.io/posts/fountaincodes/) - Transfer information over noisy channels. Example given with [txqr](https://github.com/divan/txqr) a project that uses Animated QR codes to transfer data over mobiles.
* Any [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/) essays, demo, experiments. This inspired me so much and make myself questioning my day to day life as an engineer. He made me rethink the way we explain and learn things and share them with others. I'm so frustrated not seeing his demo becoming real life products.
  * [Algojammer](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Algojammer) - A project that stole the idea of "Learning programming" is an attempt to turn Bret's work into reality.
