# Growing a product

## Methodology

* [Why we made our product roadmap public (and how to build your own)](https://frontapp.com/blog/2015/04/02/why-we-made-our-roadmap-public-and-how-to-build-your-own/) - Front application explain why they made their roadmap public. It still is the case. Personnaly, I trully believe, that secrecy doesn't help any company to expand, its capabality to execute better, and faster is. In short: users like that you share tour vision, product gets better even faster because of direct feedback, team accountability. Some public roadmaps:
  * [Trello](https://trello.com/b/nC8QJJoZ/trello-development-roadmap)
  * [Front](https://trello.com/b/kZsVVrc8/front-product-roadmap)
  * [KanbanMail](https://www.notion.so/Public-Roadmap-7adabe84ea7a47588f4b5e8fa9e5dde8)

### Deliverables

User journey maps

## Tools

* [airfocus](https://airfocus.io) - Some interesting view to render your roadmap.
* [trello](http://trello.com/) - The famous Kanban based online service to manage your task and roadmap.
* [notion.so](https://www.notion.so) - The one tool for all replacing evernote, trello, asana, etc.
* [uservoice](https://www.uservoice.com/) - User centric roadmap definition.

In any case, please avoid using [aha!](https://www.aha.io/). This is certainly unfair, but my experience with this tool, and the support team is dramatic. aha! was hated in our company. It's code name was "the place were ideas die". It was slow, hard to use, nearly impossible to find information. And, at the end we weren't able to export our data. Cherry on the cake: way too expensive.
