## Semantic segmentation

Semantic segmentation is the practice of categorizing an image at the pixel level. i.e., semantic segmentation assigns a class to each pixel in an image. Semantic segmentation was at the heart of our core products at Redbird. There are a lot activities around that topic where state of the art is still not as accurate as human. I have written a [medium post](https://medium.com/@hervenivon/crafting-the-future-was-just-the-beginning-herve-nivon-3b7312a73184) where you will find further information regarding our projects.

Here are the most relevant findings we leverage for our project and some more recent ones that can enhance it:

The GPT-2 performances are unbelievable and in the absence of clear ethics in the artificial intelligence field I can't agree more at that time. Nevertheless, I'm utterly frustrated. We need to do something about the social implications of artificial intelligence. In the [OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-2: the model, the hype, and the controversy](https://towardsdatascience.com/openais-gpt-2-the-model-the-hype-and-the-controversy-1109f4bfd5e8) blog post, the idea of a ‚Äòsafety checklist‚Äô; similarly to the recent ‚Äò[reproducibility checklist](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf)‚Äô arises. Why not?!

## Sagemaker

[`sagemaker`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) is quickly becoming a state of the art for machine learning project. It assembles under this sole name a lot of capabilities that would accelerate and standardize any launching project involving machine learning of any sort. From [collaboration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-notebooks-now-support-git-integration-for-increased-persistence-collaboration-and-reproducibility) to [continuous deployment of model](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/automated-and-continuous-deployment-of-amazon-sagemaker-models-with-aws-step-functions), through [ground truth generation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth-build-highly-accurate-datasets-and-reduce-labeling-costs-by-up-to-70) `sagemaker` provides all necessary tools for most of the use cases.

The initial version of `sagemaker` has been released on [Nov 29, 2017](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-amazon-sagemaker/). As we were working on machine learning projects applied to production in early 2016, we needed to figured out by ourselves and our small team how to build, train and deploy our custom models. Spending a consequent amount of time in setting the instances, installing latest version - available at that time - of `cuda` and `tensorflow` and connecting the dots in the process.

If I would start something new today, `sagemaker` would be my primary target as a CTO, helping my future team to focus on the value added, not the infrastructure and process on which everyone - starting with AWS - is working on.

A `sagemaker` workflow for continuous deployment ¬© [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/automated-and-continuous-deployment-of-amazon-sagemaker-models-with-aws-step-functions):

`sagemaker` use cases demonstration:

* [Analyzing live video](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/analyze-live-video-at-scale-in-real-time-using-amazon-kinesis-video-streams-and-amazon-sagemaker/)
* [Classifying high-resolution chest x-ray medical images with Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/classifying-high-resolution-chest-x-ray-medical-images-with-amazon-sagemaker/)

other `sagemaker` key features:

* [Pipe mode](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-model-training-using-faster-pipe-mode-on-amazon-sagemaker/) - It allows to stream data directly from an `S3` bucket without the need to download the data on the machine. It leverages the [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to speedup streaming from S3 to the training instances.

## Setting an artificial intelligence project

Executing an enterprise grade machine learning project is complicated, a lot of steps are necessary in a highly uncertain context. As of today, you have a lot of choices to set your projects right. Depending on your team size, you might even willing to reinvent the wheel suffering from the ["Not Invented Here"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrome. The good news is there is a lot to learn from the already maturing industry. Here are some source to read before jumping straight ahead!

* [How to build a machine learning team when you are not google or facebook](https://www.wandb.com/blog/how-to-build-a-machine-learning-team-when-you-are-not-google-or-facebook) - Pragmatism has always been at the heart of our strategy regarding our machine learning projects. This article formalize best practice that a good manager will discover himself executing a machine learning project. One thing for sure, as of today, "it‚Äôs more efficient to teach a engineers machine learning than to teach machine learning practitioners how to be good engineers." And, with the right project and the rock solid computer scientist you can kick-start a machine learning in a small team.
* Productionizing an artificial intelligence project, tracking its progress or solely being able to reproduce an experiment is a challenge. A traditional system is seen as deterministic, for a particular version of your code, you have specific behavior. You can upgrade your software or dependencies to a particular version to benefit some improvements or you can roll-back to a previous version of it if you face some unexpected issues. Infrastructure as code paradigm enables the same features for the underlying elements supporting your project. For years now, continuous delivery is a well-known concept, often applied in production. When it comes to artificial intelligence projects it is steadily way more tricky: how do you manage that so-called black box? The good news is that the black box can also be versioned. You can version an artificial intelligence project on [different axes](https://emilygorcenski.com/post/data-versioning): code, model, data schema, data values, and data annotations. There is not only one approach, and it can become highly complex. It depends on your project ambition, data variation, number of people involved, go-live frequencies, etc. You must find the most appropriate way for each project. In my experience, versioning models, associated code and data annotations have proven to be the bare minimum - and even it wasn't always sufficient to reproduce a particular experiment. Some tools or services might assist you in this mission:
  * [comet](https://comet.ml)
  * [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/dvc-philosophy/core-features)
  * [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)
* [IBM Machine Learning Maturity Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04871) - Presents a set of best practices to implement when a company wants to deploy machine learning at scale and in a friendly fashion with enterprise landscape. Many of them might be complicated to achieve, anyhow, it will highlight any shortcomings in your projects or potential area of focus.

My synthesis: also look at The-Roadmap-to-Machine-Learning-Maturity-v1.pdf

Conclusions:

* Don't reinvent the wheel, just like all other computer science project!
* Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty, if you are working on cutting edge projects, your data won't be annotated. Obviously you can outsource annotation, but one need to understand what it means.
* Be humble, the research is going really blasting [fast](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612582/data-that-illuminates-the-ai-boom/).
* Accept failure, and be patient. Only one thing is sure, in any machine learning project you'll met failure. Reaching success might be a long way...
