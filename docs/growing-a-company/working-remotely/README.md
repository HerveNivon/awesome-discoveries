# Working Remotely

The cost of living is increasing so much in so many places that it is not a risk anymore; it is an issue for most of us. Our world is rapidly changing, and one thing is for sure, we will see more and more all-remote workforces rather than the contrary.

Also, talents are all around the world, not only close to the place you are physically located. In the fast pace economy, it is crucial to get the right skills at the right time.

Being able to handle and support remote workforces - either they are partial or 100% - is key to any modern company. From the new generation's habits to the cost of living in world capitals, this is becoming a mandatory capability.

The following paragraph assembles my findings on that topic.
