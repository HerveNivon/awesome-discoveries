# Development

* Programming paradigms
  * [Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53) - That lecture helps to jolt away preconceived ideas that have been learned over the years OR simply point usual mistakes. Take a look. _(`OO`)_
* Code quality
  * [Code climate](https://codeclimate.com/quality/) - A lot of tools in the industry, give a try to this one.
* Tutorials
  * [GraphQL API with AWS and Use with React](https://scotch.io/tutorials/graphql-api-with-aws-and-use-with-react) - Setting a `graphql` API along with a react application on AWS and AWS Amplify.

## Software design and principles

### mono-repo vs multi-repo | microservices vs monolith

We have experienced both mono repo and multi repo along with microservices and monolith for years now. My conclusion regarding our context:

* It is hard to set a mono repository right,
* It is harder to manage hundreds of repository for several service right,
* You have to build or use tools dedicated to mono repository management, and in particular for continuous integration,
* A monorepo still is way more efficient regarding deployment, coherence, bug tracking, cleaning and "community management",
* Microservices are way more efficient in term of flexibility, possible innovation and creativity, overall velocity,
* The microservices set in a monorepo combination was perfect for our team, size and project.
* Continuous delivery setup is a journey. Keep the focus and priority: often it is delivering reliably new features to your customers.

Several sources, so you can have a better idea of the debate:

* [Segment's transition back to a monorepo](https://changelog.com/podcast/312) and its original [blog post](https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/)
* [Confessions of Continuous Delivery Experts: From microservices back to monolith](https://www.gocd.org/2017/12/06/confessions-continuous-delivery-experts-snapci-microservices-monolith/) - Lesson learnt moving from microservice to monolith.

For the same context that were ours, what I might consent is to split application tiers into different repositories (example: front-end in one repository, back-end in another), that's all!

## Development environment

### iPad as main computer

* [iPad Pro for programming](https://jann.is/ipad-pro-for-programming/)
* Mosh (a "better" ssh):
  * [mobile-shell build instruction](https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/wiki/Build-Instructions)
  * [Setting mosh server on AWS](http://aws-labs.com/install-mosh/)
  * [Adding mosh support to your AWS servers](http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/aws/2017/07/02/adding-mosh-support-to-your-aws-servers.html)
  * [Mosh is available on AWS Linux](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2017.03-packages/)

A lot of people have tried, I tried, the last iteration of the iPad pro almost convinced me. For me, this is still not possible. It is fine to programm remotely with a AWS server but it is expensive, and doesn't cover all usages. What if you need to manipulate data from your iPad on your remote server? I need to programmaticaly access my data locally, that's all. I still need my "natural" terminal with data access.

In the process, I discovered mosh and that is a damned good solution for remote access to server. It misses a strong solution for ssh forwarding necessary in a bastion implementation.

### Mac OS X

Mac OS X on a MacBook is a wonderfull development environment. When we have been acquired by Airware, all our developers had to switch from a centralized development server to distributed development environment on Mac OS X. As we hadn't raised much, we were almost shocked by that sudden developer onboarding cost increase.

It enabled smoother meeting sessions, remote working and for some others it offered a real computer at home.

You can heavily personalize your setup, but there is only one real big issue when you unbox a Mac. It lakes a real package manager, but there is a solution for that: [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

I'll do nothing else in the future. My developers will have choice between a laptop Mac or Linux one. In any case a Linux/Unix base centralised development environment with a crypted harddrive.

#### Automation

In order to setup a brand new Mac from scratch I build a bootstraping script that:

* Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* Install [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas), a Mac App Store command line utility
* Install xcode tools
* Install usefull packages (such as aws cli, htop, mosh, etc.)
* Setup [zsh](http://zsh.org/), [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) and [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
* Bind my [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) with my `$HOME` directory

You can find more details [here](https://github.com/hervenivon/dotfiles)

Some more complete example or tools are available out there:

* [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap) - The so called "minimal" macOS development system bootstrap will give you way more than mine previously mentioned.
* [mac setup](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/) - The reference guide for setting up a mac for development "manually". Source is available [here](https://github.com/sb2nov/mac-setup)

### Code editor

[`vscode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) replaces the long 1st in my heart [`Sublime`](https://www.sublimetext.com/): it has proven to turn myself into a better "prototyper", data extractor and developer in the past year. It is reliable, able to handle large files, has a small memory footprint and perfectly extendable.

My mandatory extensions:

* [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) - You might spend a bunch of time configuring `vscode` (extensions, settings and keybindings). When you are changing your computer, you are happy being able to grasp all that configuration automatically. One extension to rule them all!.

Further awesomenesssss ü§©:

* [awesome-vscode](https://github.com/viatsko/awesome-vscode) - a extensive list of interesting resources for `vscode`.
* [code-server](https://github.com/codercom/code-server) - Executing vscode in webbrowser from your server!

### Command line enhancements

* [`fkill-cli`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fkill-cli) - An interactive killing command, much nicer than your traditional way. Would love a native one not going through `node`.
* [`graphcurl`](https://github.com/hasura/graphqurl) - Turn your command line into a `curl` like tool for GraphQL, keeping the exploration taste of [graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
* [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - Must have tool for any modern devOps or serious people working with a `Terminal` üòÑ _(`json`)_
* [`rb`](https://github.com/thisredone/rb) - Extends your command line workflow with a fully loaded inline ruby interpreter. Just in case you are alergic to `awk` and `sed` _(`Ruby`)_
* [`terminalizer`](https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer) - A way to record your `Terminal` and create gif images.
* [`tldr`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) - Ever wanted to get just what you need instead of verbose man pages?
* [`q`](https://github.com/harelba/q) - Run SQL queries directly on CSV files.
* [`up`](https://github.com/akavel/up) - Write pipe processing with instant live preview of command results.

### Docker

### Security

* [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) - Waiting for github next move in the security landscape, here is a way for you to scan code source for unencrypted secrets. üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Languages and technologies

### `CSS`

CSS animations in [action](http://animista.net/play/background/color-change)

### `Javascript`

* Command line
  * [ervy](https://github.com/chunqiuyiyu/ervy) - Bringing charts to the terminal, because every project needs a command line and dataviz is fun!
  * [qoa](https://github.com/klaussinani/qoa) - Minimal interactive command-line prompts with no dependencies.

### `Python`

Python comes with a lot of popular Python libraries and frameworks. The following diagram made by [Paco Nathan](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/datascience/people/paco-nathan) is a landscape diagram that introduces 50 of the most popular Python libs used in [data science](./data-science). It was introduced in ["A landscape diagram for Python data"](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/datascience/blogs/paco-nathan/2019/03/12/a-landscape-diagram-for-python-data). Definitely the place to go first if you are looking for something.

#### Performance

Performance (or lake of) drains a lot of attention in python. It is not a compiled language, and yes, it can be slow. Have a look to the following, some extra to enhance your beautiful python code.
