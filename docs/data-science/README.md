# Data science

To start this section, I would like to emphasize how wrong some of us are approching any data science related topics, I'm pleading for generalists team in opposition to specialists, in particular in early stages of a project. From the talks and meetups I assisted to my own experience, I confirm that [you learn on the go, not before you go](https://hbr.org/2019/03/why-data-science-teams-need-generalists-not-specialists) and, that a strong computer scientist is better than two PhD.

Some drawbacks of specialists teams:

1. It narrows team's point of view - Specialization rewards people augmenting their knowledge in a particular area focus and digging their expertise domain. A way more rewarding path is serendipity and curiosity that a generalist is more willing to trigger
1. It increases coordination cost - The number of relationships $(r)$ [grows as a function of members](https://amzn.to/2HGwixJ) $$(n)$$ per this equation: $$r = (n^2-n) / 2$$. And, each relationship involves some coordination cost.

1. It augments your time to market - You need to go through an industrialisation phase and sometimes to reimplement everything

## Data management

* [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/dvc-philosophy/core-features) - A neat structured approach to the data science workflow management aiming to become a standard as git has become in the development workflow.

## Dataviz

* [Edward Tufteâ€™s The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://amzn.to/2ROaWUl) - The first book to read when you are entering the world of data visualization.
* [3rd Wave Data Visualization](https://towardsdatascience.com/3rd-wave-data-visualization-824c5dc84967) - Elijah Meeks author of [semiotic](https://github.com/emeeks/semiotic) - A react + d3.js library, a famous combo I experienced with success and pleasure - points to problems into the current landscape of data visualization.
* [PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP: Modern Approaches to Dimension Reduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8rfrqg/pca_tsne_and_umap_modern_approaches_to_dimension/) - You always have too many dimension to play with, and a picture still worth a thousand words. Here enters dimension reduction algorithms
* [Dataviz Collection](https://www.pinterest.fr/acatonrails/data-viz/) - I'm collecting things a lot, here is my personnal collection of inspiring Datavizualisation.
* Beware of the answers you'll find and always be skeptic first. That a service you owe yourself:
  * [Curve Fitting](https://xkcd.com/2048/) - A drawing worths a thousand words.
  * [Importance of Skepticism in Data Science](https://jhu-advdatasci.github.io/2018/lectures/12-being-skeptical.html) - This long code detailed lecture aims at illustrating the bias that you might follow when you are interpreting data you have manipulated. _(`R`)_
