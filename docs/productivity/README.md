# Productivity

The following are my day to day productivity tools:

* [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com) - The best english spell checker I've tried so far. I use it everyday. They also have a keyboard for iOS. They are missing an API to create 3rd party applications, like a vscode spell checker for `markdown` ðŸ˜‘.
* [Todoist](https://todoist.com) - Simplest yet all features included todo manager.
* [Evernote](https://evernote.com) - Powerful note taker that has neat web clipping, organization and sharing. I miss a bunch of features, like auto tagging of existing notes, archiving, smart lists, etc. But I wasn't able to find a really better alternative yet. I use it for all important article I want to preserve and for my projects.
* [Apple notes](https://www.icloud.com/) - For rapid personal note taking for meetings, interviews, etc.
* [github](https://www.github.com) - The place to go for Open Source, new discoveries garanted every day. You can also use it for your important notes like the present one ðŸ˜Š.
