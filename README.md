The GPT-2 performances are unbelievable and in the absence of clear ethics in the artificial intelligence field I can't agree more at that time. Nevertheless, I'm utterly frustrated. We need to do something about the social implications of artificial intelligence. In the [OpenAI’s GPT-2: the model, the hype, and the controversy](https://towardsdatascience.com/openais-gpt-2-the-model-the-hype-and-the-controversy-1109f4bfd5e8) blog post, the idea of a ‘safety checklist’ (similarly to the recent ‘[reproducibility checklist](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf)’) arises. Why not?!

#### Sagemaker

[`sagemaker`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) is quickly becoming a state of the art for machine learning project. It assembles under this sole name a lot of capabilities that would accelerate and standardize any launching project involving machine learning of any sort. From [collaboration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-notebooks-now-support-git-integration-for-increased-persistence-collaboration-and-reproducibility/) to [continuous deployment of model](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/automated-and-continuous-deployment-of-amazon-sagemaker-models-with-aws-step-functions/), through [ground truth generation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth-build-highly-accurate-datasets-and-reduce-labeling-costs-by-up-to-70/) `sagemaker` provides all necessary tools for most of the use cases.

The initial version of `sagemaker` has been released on [Nov 29, 2017](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-amazon-sagemaker/). As we were working on machine learning projects applied to production in early 2016, we needed to figured out by ourselves and our small team how to build, train and deploy our custom models. Spending a consequent amount of time in setting the instances, installing latest version - available at that time - of `cuda` and `tensorflow` and connecting the dots in the process.

If I would start something new today, `sagemaker` would be my primary target as a CTO, helping my future team to focus on the value added, not the infrastructure and process on which everyone - starting with AWS - is working on.

A `sagemaker` workflow for continuous deployment (© [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/automated-and-continuous-deployment-of-amazon-sagemaker-models-with-aws-step-functions/)):

{::ignore rule="MD033" relative_line="-2"}

`sagemaker` use cases demonstration:

* [Analyzing live video](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/analyze-live-video-at-scale-in-real-time-using-amazon-kinesis-video-streams-and-amazon-sagemaker/)
* [Classifying high-resolution chest x-ray medical images with Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/classifying-high-resolution-chest-x-ray-medical-images-with-amazon-sagemaker/)

other `sagemaker` key features:

* [Pipe mode](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-model-training-using-faster-pipe-mode-on-amazon-sagemaker/) - It allows to stream data directly from an `S3` bucket without the need to download the data on the machine. It leverages the [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to speedup streaming from S3 to the training instances.

#### Setting an artificial intelligence project

Creating an enterprise grade machine learning project is complicated, a lot of steps are necessary. As of today, you have a lot of choices to set your projects right. Depending on your team size, you might even willing to reinvent the wheel suffering from the ["Not Invented Here"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrome. The good news is there is a lot to learn from the already maturing industry. Here are some source to read before jumping straight ahead!

* [How to build a machine learning team when you are not google or facebook](https://www.wandb.com/blog/how-to-build-a-machine-learning-team-when-you-are-not-google-or-facebook) - Pragmatism has always been at the heart of our strategy regarding our machine learning projects. This article formalize best practice that a good manager will discover himself executing a machine learning project. One thing for sure, as of today, "it’s more efficient to teach a engineers machine learning than to teach machine learning practitioners how to be good engineers." And, with the right project and the rock solid computer scientist you can kick-start a machine learning in a small team.
* Productionizing an artificial intelligence project, tracking its progress or solely being able to reproduce an experiment is a challenge. A traditional system is seen as deterministic, for a particular version of your code, you have specific behavior. You can upgrade your software or dependencies to a particular version to benefit some improvements or you can roll-back to a previous version of it if you face some unexpected issues. Infrastructure as code paradigm enables the same features for the underlying elements supporting your project. For years now, continuous delivery is a well-known concept, often applied in production. When it comes to artificial intelligence projects it is steadily way more tricky: how do you manage that so-called black box? The good news is that the black box can also be versioned. You can version an artificial intelligence project on [different axes](https://emilygorcenski.com/post/data-versioning): code, model, data schema, data values, and data annotations. There is not only one approach, and it can become highly complex. It depends on your project ambition, data variation, number of people involved, go-live frequencies, etc. You must find the most appropriate way for each project. In my experience, versioning models, associated code and data annotations have proven to be the bare minimum - and even it wasn't always sufficient to reproduce a particular experiment. Some tools or services might assist you in this mission:
  * [comet](https://comet.ml)
  * [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/dvc-philosophy/core-features)
  * [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)
* [IBM Machine Learning Maturity Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04871.pdf) - Presents a set of best practices to implement when a company wants to deploy machine learning at scale and in a friendly fashion with enterprise landscape. Many of them might be complicated to achieve, anyhow, it will highlight any shortcomings in your projects or potential area of focus.

My synthesis: also look at The-Roadmap-to-Machine-Learning-Maturity-v1.pdf

Conclusions:

* Don't reinvent the wheel, just like all other computer science project!
* Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty, if you are working on cutting edge projects, your data won't be annotated. Obviously you can outsource annotation, but one need to understand what it means.
* Be humble, the research is going really blasting [fast](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612582/data-that-illuminates-the-ai-boom/).
* Accept failure, and be patient. Only one thing is sure, in any machine learning project you'll met failure. Reaching success might be a long way...

### Blockchain

Yes, during the last years I spent some time documenting myself on blockchain and its ecosystem. It is an emerging yet powerful new technology that deserves any tech friendly people deserve some attention or involvement into it.

### Data science

    * [Importance of Skepticism in Data Science](https://jhu-advdatasci.github.io/2018/lectures/12-being-skeptical.html) - This long code detailed lecture aims at illustrating the bias that you might follow when you are interpreting data you have manipulated. _(`R`)_
* Data management:
  * [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/dvc-philosophy/core-features) - A neat structured approach to the data science workflow management aiming to become a standard as git has become in the development workflow.

### Development

* Programming paradigms
  * [Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53) - That lecture helps to jolt away preconceived ideas that have been learned over the years OR simply point usual mistakes. Take a look. _(`OO`)_

#### Software design and principles

#### mono-repo vs multi-repo | microservices vs monolith

We have experienced both mono repo and multi repo along with microservices and monolith for years now. My conclusion regarding our context:

* It is hard to set a mono repository right,
* It is harder to manage hundreds of repository for several service right,
* You have to build or use tools dedicated to mono repository management, and in particular for continuous integration,
* A monorepo still is way more efficient regarding deployment, coherence, bug tracking, cleaning and "community management",
* Microservices are way more efficient in term of flexibility, possible innovation and creativity, overall velocity,
* The microservices set in a monorepo combination was perfect for our team, size and project.
* Continuous delivery setup is a journey. Keep the focus and priority: often it is delivering reliably new features to your customers.

Several sources, so you can have a better idea of the debate:

* [Segment's transition back to a monorepo](https://changelog.com/podcast/312) and its original [blog post](https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/)
* [Confessions of Continuous Delivery Experts: From microservices back to monolith](https://www.gocd.org/2017/12/06/confessions-continuous-delivery-experts-snapci-microservices-monolith/) - Lesson learnt moving from microservice to monolith.

For the same context that were ours, what I might consent is to split application tiers into different repositories (example: front-end in one repository, back-end in another), that's all!

#### `vscode`

[`vscode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) replaces the long 1st in my heart [`Sublime`](https://www.sublimetext.com/): it has proven to turn myself into a better "prototyper", data extractor and developer in the past year. It is reliable, able to handle large files, has a small memory footprint and perfectly extendable.

My mandatory extensions:

* [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) - You might spend a bunch of time configuring `vscode` (extensions, settings and keybindings). When you are changing your computer, you are happy being able to grasp all that configuration automatically. One extension to rule them all!.

Further awesomeness:

* [awesome-vscode](https://github.com/viatsko/awesome-vscode) - a extensive list of interesting resources for `vscode`.

#### Languages and technologies

##### `Javascript`

* Command line
  * [ervy](https://github.com/chunqiuyiyu/ervy) - Bringing charts to the terminal, because every project needs a command line and dataviz is fun!
  * [qoa](https://github.com/klaussinani/qoa) - Minimal interactive command-line prompts with no dependencies

##### `Python`

* Performances
  * [From Python to Numpy](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/) - An online book that teaches how to migrate from standard `Python` to `Numpy` through vectorization.
  * [7 Strategies for Optimizing Numerical Code](https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/seven-strategies-for-optimizing-numerical-code) - An overview of 7 technics to enhance `Python` performances.
  * [Python Data Visualization landscape](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries) - An heavy loaded landscape of data visualization tools in python ready for convergence.
  * [plot.ly](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-next-level-of-data-visualization-in-python-dd6e99039d5e) - Extensive zoom and discovery of `plotly` for `Python`.

##### `Ruby`

* Command line:

##### `Bash`

* Command line:
  * [bash-boilerplate](https://github.com/alphabetum/bash-boilerplate) - Name speaks for itself. Even today, bash might be the best answer to a simple clear problem that needs a repetitive way to being reproduced. This repository kick-starts it even further.
  * [bash-oo-framework](https://github.com/niieani/bash-oo-framework) - If `bash-boilerplate` is not enough you should find everything you need here.

##### AWS

* Lambda Optimization:
  * [Lambda optimization tip – enable HTTP keep-alive](https://theburningmonk.com/2019/02/lambda-optimization-tip-enable-http-keep-alive/) - Drastically reduce average execution time of each lambda function working with a DB

### Growing a company

This paragraph is the least technical piece of this document. It is the sum of lessons learned. This was written mainly as a guide for my future self, a guide to remember clearly what it means building something and never reinventing the weel.

#### Principles

##### Widespread core values

You should have clear and widespread core values. This core values should be part of all your interviews and you must ask each interviewed people how do they feel about them.

##### Be a leader

There is a litany of management styles in the litterature (Autocratic, Persuasive, Laissez-faire, Consultative, etc.). The past 15 years of management proved to myself that a good manager doesn't fit in one and only box. Furthermore your management style is really personnal and may vary overtime or depending of the people you interact with. It is all about Human relations.

I think that I adapt myself to my interlocutor and the situation. I might be persuasive, consultative, or laissez-faire, but inin all cases I invest a lot of my time in the relationships I'm building.

To my mind, there is only one rule of thumb, your collaborator will prefere working with a leader than with a boss!

##### English first

Everything must be written in English. And for us, French people, it is unfortunate, but bad English is still better than French. You should at least write all of your documentation in English. This is the bare minimum.

##### Data driven

Think of your product in terms of data, gather every piece of data you can, put that in your contracts and terms of services:

* It will be easier to determine the next iterations of your product (what features are used, how long did it take to load the page, what is the require accuracy)
* You will better serve your customers
* Data enables Machine Learning, the only mean actualy.

##### Cloud first

Everything must be in the cloud, every tool you’re about to use should be a service otherwise drawbacks are licensing nightmares and or on-site server maintenance. The other advantage of hosting everything in the cloud is to accelerate really strong, really quick.

##### Document everything

Every piece of your work, from idea to real life architecture, should be documented.

##### An API for everything

Every development you make should be served through an API. This is a necessary mean to enable growth of your project and your team.

##### Failure is arround the corner

Design with failure in mind. Failure is the first event you'll met in a

> "Everything fails, all the time" - Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon

Some companies are even playing with their production environment. Netflix's [Chaosmonkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey) randomly terminates computing unites that run inside of a production environment exposing engineers to failures by design. It inherently incentivizes them to build resilient services.

##### Automation is key

Automation is the key to successfull development teams. And, it should come in the early stages on your internal tooling or your production workloads. Automation will save you time and money all along your journey

Tooling your developers is mandatory, and it you should let them be free (help them to have a good development environment. Enable your developers and keep the evolution process of the tooling easy. Let them propose, enhance it and share their creation with the rest of your team.

##### Security

Security should be at the root of every choice. Your customer is your value. You will have to gain your customers’ trust, and you should do everything you can to keep it.

For any service, you should avoid to build your own authentication system and you must enable [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) as soon as possible. One password to rule them all is key to most B2B deals.

[GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/) is here to help anyway.

##### Be proud

Overall, assume your choices, justify them, and proudly defend them. This is not because you are not using the last trendy single page application framework that your code base is crap or a spaghetti mess - like I eared for our code base at Redbird. Your startup will always have a history, you must be proud of it and all the lessons learned along the way.
