#### Sagemaker

[`sagemaker`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) is quickly becoming a state of the art for machine learning project. It assembles under this sole name a lot of capabilities that would accelerate and standardize any launching project involving machine learning of any sort. From [collaboration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-notebooks-now-support-git-integration-for-increased-persistence-collaboration-and-reproducibility/) to [continuous deployment of model](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/automated-and-continuous-deployment-of-amazon-sagemaker-models-with-aws-step-functions/), through [ground truth generation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth-build-highly-accurate-datasets-and-reduce-labeling-costs-by-up-to-70/) `sagemaker` provides all necessary tools for most of the use cases.

The initial version of `sagemaker` has been released on [Nov 29, 2017](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-amazon-sagemaker/). As we were working on machine learning projects applied to production in early 2016, we needed to figured out by ourselves and our small team how to build, train and deploy our custom models. Spending a consequent amount of time in setting the instances, installing latest version - available at that time - of `cuda` and `tensorflow` and connecting the dots in the process.

If I would start something new today, `sagemaker` would be my primary target as a CTO, helping my future team to focus on the value added, not the infrastructure and process on which everyone - starting with AWS - is working on.

A `sagemaker` workflow for continuous deployment (© [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/automated-and-continuous-deployment-of-amazon-sagemaker-models-with-aws-step-functions/)):

{::ignore rule="MD033" relative_line="-2"}

`sagemaker` use cases demonstration:

* [Analyzing live video](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/analyze-live-video-at-scale-in-real-time-using-amazon-kinesis-video-streams-and-amazon-sagemaker/)
* [Classifying high-resolution chest x-ray medical images with Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/classifying-high-resolution-chest-x-ray-medical-images-with-amazon-sagemaker/)

other `sagemaker` key features:

* [Pipe mode](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-model-training-using-faster-pipe-mode-on-amazon-sagemaker/) - It allows to stream data directly from an `S3` bucket without the need to download the data on the machine. It leverages the [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to speedup streaming from S3 to the training instances.

#### Various

Going all directions:

* [Robust Website Fingerprinting Through the Cache Occupancy Channel](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07153.pdf) - What if you can leverage machine learning and a Javascript security hole to track anyone browsing history?

  * [EnergyVault](https://energyvault.ch/#operating-parameters) - The cleverest idea ever regarding energy storage. Thinking out of the box is key when you are growing a startup. Here is the perfect example.

#### Setting a machine learning project

Creating an enterprise grade machine learning project is complicated, a lot of steps are necessary. As of today, you have a lot of choices to set your projects right. Depending on your team size, you might even willing to reinvent the wheel suffering from the ["Not Invented Here"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrome. The good news is there is a lot to learn from the already maturing industry. Here are some source to read before jumping straight ahead!

* [How to build a machine learning team when you are not google or facebook](https://www.wandb.com/blog/how-to-build-a-machine-learning-team-when-you-are-not-google-or-facebook) - Pragmatism has always been at the heart of our strategy regarding our machine learning projects. This article formalize best practice that a good manager will discover himself executing a machine learning project. One thing for sure, as of today, "it’s more efficient to teach a engineers machine learning than to teach machine learning practitioners how to be good engineers." And, with the right project and the rock solid computer scientist you can kick-start a machine learning in a small team.
* [IBM Machine Learning Maturity Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04871.pdf) - Presents a set of best practices to implement when a company wants to deploy machine learning at scale and in a friendly fashion with enterprise landscape. Many of them might be complicated to achieve, anyhow, it will highlight any shortcomings in your projects or potential area of focus.
* Services that might help you:
  * [comet](https://comet.ml)
  * [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/dvc-philosophy/core-features)

My synthesis: also look at The-Roadmap-to-Machine-Learning-Maturity-v1.pdf

Conclusions:

* Don't reinvent the wheel, just like all other computer science project!
* Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty, if you are working on cutting edge projects, your data won't be annotated. Obviously you can outsource annotation, but one need to understand what it means.
* Be humble, the research is going really blasting [fast](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612582/data-that-illuminates-the-ai-boom/).
* Accept failure, and be patient. Only one thing is sure, in any machine learning project you'll met failure. Reaching success might be a long way...

### Blockchain

Yes, during the last years I spent some time documenting myself on blockchain and its ecosystem. It is an emerging yet powerful new technology that deserves any tech friendly people deserve some attention or involvement into it.

### Data science

* Dataviz:
  * [Edward Tufte’s The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://amzn.to/2ROaWUl) - The first book to read when you are entering the world of data visualization.

  * Beware of the answers you'll find and always skeptic first. That a service you owe yourself:
    * [Curve Fitting](https://xkcd.com/2048/) - A drawing worths a thousand words.
    * [Importance of Skepticism in Data Science](https://jhu-advdatasci.github.io/2018/lectures/12-being-skeptical.html) - This long code detailed lecture aims at illustrating the bias that you might follow when you are interpreting data you have manipulated. _(`R`)_
* Data management:
  * [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/dvc-philosophy/core-features) - A neat structured approach to the data science workflow management aiming to become a standard as git has become in the development workflow.

### Development

* Programming paradigms

#### Software design and principles

#### mono-repo vs multi-repo | microservices vs monolith

We have experienced both mono repo and multi repo along with microservices and monolith for years now. My conclusion regarding our context:

* It is hard to set a mono repository right,
* It is harder to manage hundreds of repository for several service right,
* You have to build or use tools dedicated to mono repository management, and in particular for continuous integration,
* A monorepo still is way more efficient regarding deployment, coherence, bug tracking, cleaning and "community management",
* Microservices are way more efficient in term of flexibility, possible innovation and creativity, overall velocity,
* The microservices set in a monorepo combination was perfect for our team, size and project.
* Continuous delivery setup is a journey. Keep the focus and priority: often it is delivering reliably new features to your customers.

Several sources, so you can have a better idea of the debate:

* [Segment's transition back to a monorepo](https://changelog.com/podcast/312) and its original [blog post](https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/)
* [Confessions of Continuous Delivery Experts: From microservices back to monolith](https://www.gocd.org/2017/12/06/confessions-continuous-delivery-experts-snapci-microservices-monolith/) - Lesson learnt moving from microservice to monolith.

For the same context that were ours, what I might consent is to split application tiers into different repositories (example: front-end in one repository, back-end in another), that's all!

#### `vscode`

[`vscode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) replaces the long 1st in my heart [`Sublime`](https://www.sublimetext.com/): it has proven to turn myself into a better "prototyper", data extractor and developer in the past year. It is reliable, able to handle large files, has a small memory footprint and perfectly extendable.

My mandatory extensions:

* [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) - You might spend a bunch of time configuring `vscode` (extensions, settings and keybindings). When you are changing your computer, you are happy being able to grasp all that configuration automatically. One extension to rule them all!.

Further awesomeness:

* [awesome-vscode](https://github.com/viatsko/awesome-vscode) - a extensive list of interesting resources for `vscode`.

#### Languages and technologies

##### `Javascript`

* Command line
  * [ervy](https://github.com/chunqiuyiyu/ervy) - Bringing charts to the terminal, because every project needs a command line and dataviz is fun!

##### `Python`

* Performances

### Productivity tools

The following are my day to day productivity tools:
